# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This "Study Guide" was created so I could familiarize myself with the tools utilized in the UT-Austin Bootcamp for Full Stack development. Obviously, the information it contains is limited and there are better resources. The purpose was really to teach me how to set up HTML, CSS, and Javascript together, utilizing a Git workflow process in order to prepare for more challenging projects in the Bootcamp, and in professional settings post-graduation.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Using this "Study Guide" for study is not advised. However, for a potential employer scoping out my developing JS skills, you may want to take a look in the Console by right-clicking in the web page and selecting "Inspect." Then, click on the Console tab within the window that pops up.

## Credits

I would like to thank the authors of the UT-Austin Bootcamp Canvas page otherwise known as "bootcampspot" for walking me step-by-step through this process. It was a gentle introduction to the tools.
